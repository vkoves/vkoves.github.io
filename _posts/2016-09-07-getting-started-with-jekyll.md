Working with Jekyll is a whole lot easier than dealing with tons and tons
of very redundant (and not at all DRY) HTML code. However, there's a few 
tricks that I've come up with and used to help make life easier when using
Jekyll.

{% highlight html linenos %}
<html>
	<div class="moo"></div>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight css linenos %}
#id:active
{
	background-color: red;
}
{% endhighlight %}
