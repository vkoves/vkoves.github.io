title: Want to Stop Climate Change? Ditch The Natural Gas
---

At this point, I think everyone knows about climate change, and discussions
have moved from debating the impacts to what we should be doing to prevent it.
Big companies love to ask you to take a look at your carbon footprint, while
some activists counter that your individual impact is negligible compared to
the emissions of large companies. I want to show you that it's a bit of both.

What if I told you there is one part of the emissions of our world that
_only_ you can change? Unlike making the grid run on renewable energy or making
planes that don't emit tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, these changes are up to you,
because these emissions come from _inside_ your home.

Not sure what I'm referring to? I'm talking about natural gas home heaters,
water heaters, stoves, and dryers. Natural gas is made primarily out of methane
([Natural Gas Explained | EIA](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/)) a fossil fuel
that, when burned, emits carbon dioxide and a host of other pollutants:

> &ldquo;The emissions from natural gas-fired boilers and furnaces include
  nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide
  (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O),
  volatile organic compounds (VOCs), trace amounts of sulfur dioxide
  (SO<sub>2</sub>), and particulate matter (PM).&rdquo;
  â€” [EPA Report AP 42, Section 1.4](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-09/documents/1.4_natural_gas_combustion.pdf)

There's been some research showing that the emissions coming from your gas
appliances (particularly your gas stove, since you spend more time around it)
emit some of these pollutants in levels high enough to be
harmful ([CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/gas-stoves-air-pollution-1.6394514)).
Methane is also an _extremely_ potent greenhouse gas by itself, estimated to have
a greenhouse effect about 27-30 times that of carbon dioxide over 100 years
([Understanding Global Warming Potentials, EPA](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials)).
That means that even a little bit of methane leaking out from your stove, the
pipes that get natural gas to your home, or anywhere along the production
process can have a huge impact on climate change.

Ultimately, all of these emissions from natural gas use mean one very simple
thing - **even on a grid powered completely by renewable energy, our  natural
gas appliances emit dangerous green-house gases that warm the planet.**
It's worth reiterating - even if we closed down every fossil fuel power plant
and moved every gas car to an electric vehicle, our homes would still be
collectively pumping colossal amounts of methane and carbon dioxide into the air.

That means that we absolutely cannot get to zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (and
solve the climate crisis) without moving all of our gas appliances to electric
ones. There's a lot of knock-on benefits to this too - your electric appliances
don't create as many harmful pollutants and don't leak methane, and induction cooktops (which are
electrically powered) even bring water to a boil faster and don't leave cooktops hot
(["Induction Cooking - here's Why You Should Make The Switch" | Reviewed.com](https://www.reviewed.com/ovens/features/induction-101-better-cooking-through-science)).

Now let me be clear - home natural gas use isn't the majority of emissions in the US (or worldwide),
but it is a significant source of emissions. Let's do some quick napkin math:

1. From the EPA we know that there's <strong>0.0551 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted per
thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of natural gas</strong> burned
([Greenhouse Gases Equivalencies Calculator | EPA](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gases-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references#therms)).

1. From the U.S. Energy Information Administration we know that <strong>residential natural
gas use was 4.65 trillion cubic feet in 2021</strong>
([Natural Gas Explained | EIA](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/use-of-natural-gas.php))

1. From math class we know one trillion is 1,000,000,000,000 or more simply
10<sup>12</sup>, while one thousand is 1,000 or 10<sup>3</sup>.

1. That means by dividing our previous 0.0551 tons CO<sub>2</sub> per thousands
of cubic feet number by 10<sup>3</sup> we get that a single cubic foot of natural gas
emits 0.0000551 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub>.

That means to get our total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from residential natural
gas use we need to take 4.65 trillion cubic feet and multiply by
0.0000551 metric tons CO<sub>2</sub> per cubic foot.

Or written out:

<img src="/post-assets/gas-co2-eq.svg"
  width="80%"
  alt="Formula '4.65 * 10^12 cubic ft natural gas * 0.0000551 metrics tons CO2 / 1 cubic ft natural gas'"
  class="-no-shadow -with-background">

If you punch that into a calculator, you'll get back 256,215,000 metric tons of
CO<sub>2</sub>. That means that <strong>residential natural gas use emitted approximately
 256 million metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> in 2021 alone!</strong>

For comparison, according to
[Our World In Data's US Emissions Page](https://ourworldindata.org/co2/country/united-states#what-are-the-country-s-annual-co2-emissions)
the US emitted 4.71 billion metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> in 2020 (there's no data for 2021 yet) making the
256 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by natural gas US 5.4% of the overall
total. And keep in mind this emissions estimate doesn't account for natural gas
leaks, emissions from extracting, producing, and distributing the natural gas,
or other factors, so the true emissions are even higher.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="So Why Should I Care About 5% Of US Emissions?" level=2 %}

That 5.4% figure might leave you wondering - why should you care, and why
did I even write an article about this? Aren't there more important things to
worry about? There's one big reason - electrifying your home appliances (for
home-owners) is _completely in your control_. It might not be
cheap, and we should definitely make policies providing rebates and regulating
appliances in new construction, but the next time you are purchasing appliances
you can choose to make them electric.

And of course it's worth mentioning that if you own a gas car, that is likely
the biggest CO<sub>2</sub> emitting machine you own, with the [average passenger car emitting
4.6 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> according to the EPA](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle).
Considering [the average American emits around 14.2 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> a year](https://ourworldindata.org/co2/country/united-states#per-capita-how-much-co2-does-the-average-person-emit),
that means a <strong>gas car could make up a whopping 32% of your emissions</strong>.
That means the next time you are buying a new car, you can have a huge climate
impact by making it an electric vehicle!

<p class="small">
  An obligatory aside - as an avid city biker and transit user I also have to
  mention ditching a car entirely is also an option! There's a lot of benefits if you
  can make it work, and especially in a dense city, cars (electric or otherwise)
  are extremely expensive and not an efficient way to move lots of people around
  compared to trains, buses, or biking.

I think all of this highlights a broader point - climate change is a
collective problem, and we need to act collectively to solve it. This includes
all the big collective stuff, from voting on climate issues, talking to your
friends about climate change, getting big companies to reduce their emissions,
and calling your elected officials to support climate legislation. But it also
means individual actions, like changing out your fossil fuel powered machines
for electric ones and letting solar and wind power be built in your local community.

Solving climate change isn't just about avoiding a terrifying future - it also
lets us build a world with cleaner air inside and outside the home, where the
power of the sun and the wind can get you to work, heat your home, and cook your
food. That sounds like a bright future worth fighting for.

Lastly, I want to plug [Decarbonize My State](https://decarbonizemystate.com/),
a project I've contributed to that seeks to help visualize a lot of this
information on a state by state basis. If you're curious what the biggest sources
of emissions are in your state, I'd encourage you to check it out.


{% include linkedHeading.html heading="I Have Some Gripes (Counter Points)" level=2 %}

Alright, alright, you read this and you have some issues with my points. Let me
just address a few that I've seen:

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Electric cooking sucks, I love cooking with gas!" level=3 %}
Check out [wtf is 'induction cooking' on YouTube][wtf-is-induction], which walks through induction cooking through a
cook's perspective. The old school electric stoves (the ones with the coils that
glow red) often were really annoying and had lots of problems, but induction
works totally differently and is _much_ better in a variety of ways. If you can,
try it at a friend's house or buy a small induction cooktop to test with.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Most US electricity comes from natural gas anyway ðŸ™„" level=3 %}

Alright, alright, no need for the eye roll! There's a few things to unpack here, but let's
start with the face value argument here - that if the electric grid is mostly
natural gas, there's no point switching to electric appliances. This isn't true for one simple reason - a giant
gas power plant is going to be much more efficient at converting natural gas into energy
than your home stove, and electric stoves lose less energy than gas stoves.

But also, there's a few other factors that challenge this:

1. **The US energy grid already has 20% of power coming from renewables, and 20%
from nuclear**, meaning (in rough terms) that 40% of electricity in the US is
carbon free _today_. ([Electricity Explained | EIA][eia-electricity-explained])
1. **The share of energy coming from renewables is steadily increasing**
([Electricity Explained | EIA][eia-electricity-explained]), so the grid is getting
cleaner all the time. This means your electric appliances get emit less
and less over time.
1. **If you buy a gas stove or car now you're _committing_ to future emissions** -
related to points 1 and 2 above, if you buy a gas appliance you're not just
emitting today, you're locking in emissions for the time until that appliance is
replaced, often for a decade more. These so-called committed emissions already
jeopardize us hitting our climate goals
([Committed emissions from existing energy... | Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1364-3)),
which is why **it's crucial we don't buy new fossil fuel powered appliances!**
