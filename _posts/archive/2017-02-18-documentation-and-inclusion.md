title: Documentation & Inclusion Lightning Talk

I gave a lightning talk at Chi Hack Night about documentation and inclusion, and this is a delayed follow up to that talk with
links the video and the slides. In my work professionally, academically, and in the community, I have found documentation to play
a pivotal role in improving the inclusiveness of a project, and this talk was a way to share some of my thoughts.
