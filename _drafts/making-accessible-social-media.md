title: "Making Accessible Content - From Social Media to Blogs"
---

Accessibility isn't just for websites - it is also integral for all of your
content. Let's walk through some fundamental accessibility principles and how
they apply to content like social media posts or blog articles.

## The Fundamental Principles

### Text Alternatives

For any type of content you create, you want to make sure there is some kind of
text alternative for users who can't engage with your content in the way you may
have initially planned.

FOr example, if you're uploading a podcast, or audio clip, it's important to
caption your audio or provide a transcript if that's not possible. That way,
your audience can see your content even if they are deaf or hard of hearing.

### Contrast

Whether it's the text in an article or some writing in an image, you always want
to make sure that your text and backgrounds are contrast compliant.

Now let's see how these principles apply to a few different types of content.

## Accessible Images

Ensure any text in your images is contrast compliant! With images, this can be
a bit more complex since you might heave text just over a background, so you
might want to sample a few spots near your text to ensure that the text is
always sufficiently contrasting from the background.
