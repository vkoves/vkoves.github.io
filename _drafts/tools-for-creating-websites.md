In creating websites, there are a few (mostly free) tools that I have
used on almost every website I've built. Here's a list of these tools
and what I use them for. 

Some tools I use
## IcoMoon
IcoMoon is a website for finding icons, and it has lots of free icon sets
(and some paid ones) that can help you when making any kind of app or website.

## Google Fonts
A good website needs good fonts, but hosting your own fonts, and making sure
they are compatible across different devices, can be a real pain. This is
where Google Fonts can help.

## Pingdom Website Speed Test
Everyone wants to have a fast website, but without specific technical knowledge
it can be hard to benchmark your site speed and figure out hwo you can improve it.
Pingdom's Website Speed Test helps with this, giving you the speed of your website
from different locations around the world, as well as suggestions for improvements.

## Google Page Speed Insights
Similar to Pingdom's Website Speed Test, Google Page Speed Insights grades your
website and gives you suggestion for how you can make it better. It also includes
a mobile recommendation set, so you can make sure your website suits the needs of your
mobile users.

## Google Analytics and Google Search Console
Google Analytics is a very common tool that's used by most major websites for tracking
user traffic and gaining insights about how your website is performing with users.

## Kraken
One of the biggest bottle necks faced by modern websites is the size of their image
content, which can bloat the website and make it take much longer to load. Kraken
has developed a very good algorithm for compressing images extremely efficiently
without losing quality, helping you create a good looking image heavy website
without it taking several seconds to download.

## Amazon S3 & Amazon CloudFront
It can be a challenge to host the large amounts of media that is associated with
a modern website, especially if you have a large international audience. Amazon S3
is a multimedia storage host with very affordable pricing (and a 12 month free trial)
that can be used for hosting images, video, audio and more. Amazon S3 is also extended
by Amazon CloudFront, Amazon's global CDN, which helps decrease download times of your
media assets around the world.

## GIMP
I am by no means a photo editing professional, so I find the extensive features (and the
high price) of Photoshop to be a bit too much for my needs. However, when I need to do
basic image editing, GIMP serves me very well.

## InkScape
Sometimes you need to modify SVG assets, changing their color or removing details, and 
Inkscape is a free tool to help you with that. I usually use it after download icons
from icomoon to match the color pallete of my website.

## Github Pages
You shouldn't have to pay to host a basic website, and with GitHub Pages, you don't have
to pay at all. You can host websites for your Github repositories, or create a website
for your GitHub user for free. Lots of developers use GitHub pages to create resume sites,
but you can use it for any website where you don't need a proper backend server. GitHub
Pages also supports Jekyll (which powers this website!). 

## Sublime Text
If you are making lots of websites, you need a powerful and light-weight editor to help
you, and Sublime Text has been my go to for a few years now. With a lot of powerful packages,
built-in syntax for loads of languages, and useful functionality like multiple cursors and
extensive keyboard shortcuts, I can't imagine working in anything else.
