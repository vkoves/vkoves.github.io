title: "My Journey With Accessibility: Making My Own Site Accessible"
---

These days, accessibility is one of my biggest passions and something that I
am proud to know a lot about, but it wasn't always this way. Let me tell you how
I went about fixing my old, inaccessible site, and bringing it up to the new
standards I have learned so much about.

1. Test
2. Fix
3. Repeat


Despite my best efforts, automated tools and using a screen reader as a sighted
user is only a best guess at what users might really need. I was very
appreciative when someone reachd out to me on LinkedIn and told me that they
had a hard time navigating my portfolio page because I hadn't used headers to
break apart the page.

This is something I had completely missed in my testing! I was looking so much
at automated auditing tools and full-on accessibility "failures" that I missed
a huge piece of usability improvement.
