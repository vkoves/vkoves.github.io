title: Want to Stop Climate Change? Ditch The Natural Gas
---

At this point, I think everyone knows about climate change on one level or
another, and the real discussions we are having is around what we should be
doing about it. Big companies love to ask you to take a look at your carbon
footprint, while lots of activists counter that your individual impact is
negligible compared to the emissions of large companies.

Well, what if I told you there is one part of the emissions of our world that
_only_ you can change? Unlike making the grid run on renewable energy or making
planes that don't emit tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, these changes are up to you,
because these emissions come from _inside_ your home.

Not sure what I'm referring to? I'm talking about natural gas home heaters,
water heaters, stoves, and dryers. Natural gas is made primarily out of methane
([source, EIA](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/)) a fossil fuel
that, when burned, emits carbon dioxide and a host of other pollutants:

> &ldquo;The emissions from natural gas-fired boilers and furnaces include
  nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide
  (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O),
  volatile organic compounds (VOCs), trace amounts of sulfur dioxide
  (SO<sub>2</sub>), and particulate matter (PM).&rdquo;
  â€” [EPA Report AP 42, Section 1.4](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-09/documents/1.4_natural_gas_combustion.pdf)

There's been some research showing that the emissions coming from your gas
appliances (particularly your gas stove, since you spend more time around it)
emit some of these pollutants in levels high enough to be
harmful ([CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/gas-stoves-air-pollution-1.6394514)),
which is also not a great .

Methane is also an _extremely_ potent greenhouse gas by itself, estimated to be
about 27-30 times that of carbon dioxide over 100 years
([Understanding Global Warming Potentials, EPA](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials)).
That means that even a little bit of methane leaking out from your stove, the
pipes that get natural gas to your home, or anywhere along the production
process can have a disproportionate impact.

Ultimately, all of these emissions from natural gas use mean one very simple
thing - **even on a grid powered completely by renewable energy, our  natural
gas appliances emit green-house gases.** It's worth reiterating - even if we
closed down every fossil fuel power plant and moved every gas car to an electric
vehicle, our homes would still be collectively pumping colossal amounts of
methane and carbon dioxide into the air.

That means, simply - we cannot get to zero emissions (and solve the climate
crisis) without moving all of our gas appliances to electric ones. There's a lot
of knock-on benefits to this too - your electric appliances don't create as many
harmful pollutants and don't leak methane, and induction cooktops (which are
electrically powered) even bring water to a boil faster and don't leave cooktops hot
(["Induction Cooking - here's Why You Should Make The Switch" | Reviewed.com](https://www.reviewed.com/ovens/features/induction-101-better-cooking-through-science)).

Now let me clear - home natural gas use isn't the majority of emissions worldwide,
but it is a significant proportion. Let's do some quick napkin math:

1. We know from the EPA that there's 0.0551 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per
thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of natural gas burned
([Greenhouse Gases Equivalencies Calculator | EPA](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gases-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references#therms)).
1. From the U.S. Energy Information Administration we know that residential natural
gas use accounted was 4.65 trillion cubic feet in 2021
