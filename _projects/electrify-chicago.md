Electrify Chicago is a project that was inspired by a data set that is publicly available in the City
of Chicago data portal which shows the emissions information and power use of a majority of Chicago's
largest buildings. After discovering that my own university's gym had the highest emissions per
square foot of any building in the entire city, I decided to dig in more by creating a site that
shows the existing city data in a more readable format, with rankings for buildings that are the
best and worst in each particular category.
