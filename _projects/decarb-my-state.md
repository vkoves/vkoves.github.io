Decarb My State is a project that came out of Chi Hack Night, a civic hacking group in Chicago. We
wanted to create a resource that would help turn climate change from a national to state level
issue, giving folks a more local context by breaking down the sources of emissions in their
particular state into four simple categories and then showing folks how those category's emissions
can be decarbonized.
