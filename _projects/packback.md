In my work at Packback, I have developed features large and small, worked
with auditors to validate and improve our site's accessibility, and trained
developers on accessibility best practices.

To make sure that accessibility was considered even before development, I have
also worked with our product designers, auditing designs to ensure they are
accessible and ensuring that sophisticated features are planned out to be fully
inclusive to all our users.

This work included planning and building functionality into the Packback avatar
editor that allow screen reader users to have their avatar described to them,
so that even our students with vision impairments could create an avatar on our
platform that represented them.
