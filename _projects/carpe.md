Carpe was an online scheduler designed to make organizing easier and more
socially connected. With Carpe, users could follow people to see and track their
schedules, letting them  stay up to date. It made planning everything from lunch-time
hangouts to business meetings faster and pain-free.

Carpe was a full-stack application built from the ground up with a small team in
Ruby on Rails and it had a robustly architected system of email and in-site
notifications and a groups feature that let users edit a calendar together.
