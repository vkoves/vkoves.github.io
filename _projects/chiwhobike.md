Chicagoans Who Bike is a photo and video project where I interviewed people who bike around Chicago,
and I also created a companion website, with an automated image pipeline for creating different
resolution versions of my large super high resolution photos. In addition, I leverage modern HTML
techniques to lazy load images on the homepage.
