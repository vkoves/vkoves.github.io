The Carbon Challenge came out of a simple question I had - one impact does a
_single_ policy have on average temperature rise? I had heard lots of discussion
about how we needed to reduce our emissions in the broad sense and that we had
to do so by a certain date, but it felt ambiguous and abstract. The Carbon
Challenge was my way of making that more real.

To create this project I spent dozens of hours researching and months of
development to create a robust yet simple simulation of our climate that I could
then manipulate with specific policies. I then created a clean interface
inspired by games like Sim City to make it really easy for users to pick
policies and see what impact they had.
