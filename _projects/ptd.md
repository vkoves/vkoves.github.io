The Property Tax Department LLC hired me to create a brand new signup
flow that would simplify a complex back and forth needed for them to onboard
clients. With their original process, clients only provided brief information on
their website, had to send extra information over email, and then had to be
asked to sign documents via DocuSign. All these steps mean a single customer's
signup took a lot of time and work on their part.

The new signup flow I built encouraged users to sign up with a graph of
their potential savings and allowed them to sign documents in the signup flow.
This drastically decreased the time required to onboard new customers,
and helped the PTD serve many more clients and increase conversion rates. The
new signup site was fully responsive, letting clients complete the full signup
process without leaving their phone.
