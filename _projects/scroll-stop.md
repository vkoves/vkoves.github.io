description:
    Scroll Stop was born from my desire to experiment with creating Google Chrome extension, and seizing the opportunity when a friend proposed the idea for a productivity app that specifically tackled lazy loading social media and content websites by stopping you from scrolling too far. That way if you need to message people on Facebook or other social media platforms, you still can, but it will prevent you from mindlessly scrolling through your newsfeed.
