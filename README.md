My personal website, used for everything from showcasing work to prototyping and messing around with HTML. Have suggestions or feedback? Open an issue.

## Prerequisites

Since this is a Jekyll based site, your system should have Rails
intalled (see `Gemfile` for the specific version), including bundler (installed
via `gem install bundler`).

If you don't have Ruby, you can install Ruby using [RVM](https://rvm.io/), which
lets you use any number of Ruby versions on one machine.

## Running

This project uses [Jekyll]([Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)), so to run it
locally simply do:

```shell
bundle install # install all gems
jekyll serve # host the site locally
```

The site should be hosted for you at `localhost:4000`.

## Testing

This site uses Travis for CI, but you can run the CI locally by running:

```shell
./ci.sh
```

This will build the Jekyll site and then run it through validation with
[HTML Proofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer),
[stylelint](https://stylelint.io/), and
[ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

## Features

- Gallery functionality - Powered by jQuery and some nifty CSS3, this animated gallery shows off some visual parts of my work, including a way to view titles and descriptions. The gallery images are dynamically loaded in using Javascript.

- Work - List of projects, each with its own gallery of images, description, and set of tools. This is generated via a Jekyll collection for SEO and performance.


## Notable Pages

- [Apollo](https://viktorkoves.com/apollo) -
	Spotify API powered tool for learning more about songs. It is now hosted on [its own repository](https://github.com/vkoves/apollo).
- [Christmas In Clouds](https://viktorkoves.com/projects/christmas-in-clouds/) -
	The homepage for a festive game I made for the holidays in the Unity game engine.

## Technology

This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and uses custom CSS
and jQuery for just about everything.
