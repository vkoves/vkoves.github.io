#  Viktor KÃ¶ves' Home Base
My personal website, used for everything from showcasing work to prototyping and messing around with HTML.

## Features
- Gallery - Powered by jQuery and some nifty CSS3, this animated gallery shows off some visual parts of my work, including a way to view titles and descriptions.
- Portfolio - Still WIP, but each project will have it's own gallery and description.
