#  Viktor KÃ¶ves' Home Base
My personal website, used for everything from showcasing work to prototyping and messing around with HTML. Have suggetions or feedback? Open an issue.

## Features
- Gallery - Powered by jQuery and some nifty CSS3, this animated gallery shows off some visual parts of my work, including a way to view titles and descriptions. The gallery images are dynamically loaded in using Javascript.
- Portfolio - List of projects, each with its own gallery of images, description, and set of tools. This is also dynamically generated using Javascript instead of being stored in the DOM.
- Blog - Jekyll powered blog, used for technical posts with well formatted code snippets.

## Notable Pages
- [Apollo](http://viktorkoves.com/apollo) - Spotify API powered tool for learning more about songs. It is now hosted on [its own repository](https://github.com/vkoves/apollo).
- [The Transportation Collective](http://viktorkoves.com/TransportationCollective/) - A big data capture and analysis tool designed for use with the CTA. It is hosted on [its own repository](https://github.com/vkoves/TransportationCollective).

## Technology
This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and uses custom CSS and jQuery for just about everything. You can use `jekyll serve` to run it locally, or can [view it live](http://viktorkoves.com/).
