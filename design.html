		<h4>
		A basic guide to some principals of design I've come up with as I've worked
		on various projects
		</h4>


		<h2> Obvious Design - Links </h2>
		
		Good designs make certain things very obvious. On a well designed website, 
		links look like links, and you know implicitly that you can click them. We'll 
		explore that idea with a few examples.


		<h3> Cursors </h3>
		
		Cursors are a very basic indication that something is interactive. See if you 
		can find the link in these two blocks of text. The link in the left one has no 
		cursor, the	one on the right does.

		<div class="full-width">
			<div class="two-col">
				<block id="no-style">
					Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Proin sit amet volutpat 
					ut dapibus enim laoreet lobortis. Morbi metus quam, 
					<a href="/" target="_blank">porttitor</a> 
					id commodo in, 
					sagittis non mauris. Aliquam arcu risus, lacinia sit amet rhoncus id, ullamcorper
				</block>

				<block id="cursor-only">
					Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Proin sit amet volutpat 
					ante eu ante laoreet pretium nec nec mauris. Praesent rutrum hendrerit 
					<a href="/" target="_blank">velit,</a> 
					ut dapibus enim laoreet lobortis. Morbi metus quam, porttitor id commodo in, 
				</block>
			</div>
		</div>

		That wasn't very simple in both cases, but your probably were able to find the 
		link in the right text. However, a cursor change alone isn't nearly enough. (By 
		the way, the links were the words "porttitor" and "velit" in the left and right
		examples, respectively)


		<h3> Colors &amp; Contrast </h3>
		
		Links are an important part of any website, and making sure the users knows where 
		they are is critical to a good user experience. If a user can't find a link to the 
		information you are trying to get them to see, they get frustrated. Colors can be 
		used to make links stand out, giving them contrast. Which of the links below are 
		more obvious?

		<div class="full-width">
			<div class="two-col">
				<block id="cursor-only">
					Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Proin sit amet volutpat 
					<a href="/" target="_blank">blandit.</a>
					Maecenas vel 
					ante eu ante laoreet pretium nec nec mauris. Praesent rutrum hendrerit velit, 
					nec nunc. Cras facilisis quis nisi id maximus.
				</block>

				<block id="with-color">
					Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Proin sit amet volutpat 
					ante eu ante laoreet pretium nec nec mauris. Praesent rutrum hendrerit velit, 
					ut dapibus enim laoreet 
					<a href="/" target="_blank">lobortis.</a>
					Morbi metus quam, porttitor id
				</block>
			</div>
		</div>

		It can be easily said that the link on the right is much more obvious, and much 
		more likely to be clicked. No matter how it could have been styled, the fact that 
		it has contrast and draws attention to itself improves the user experience.


		<h3> Hover Effects </h3>
		
		Adding contrast and proper cursors helps to make links and other interactive 
		content more intuitive, and draws attention to them. However, it's also important 
		to keep in mind that just because something looks different does not mean it is 
		clear that it should be clicked.

		<div class="full-width">
			<div class="two-col">
				<block id="with-color">
					ante eu ante laoreet pretium nec nec mauris. Praesent rutrum hendrerit velit, 
					ut dapibus enim laoreet 
					<a href="/" target="_blank">lobortis.</a>
					Morbi metus quam, porttitor id commodo in, 
					nec nunc. Cras facilisis quis nisi id maximus.
				</block>

				<block id="with-hover">
					Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Proin sit amet volutpat 
					orci, quis dapibus odio. Sed bibendum felis eget mollis 
					<a href="/" target="_blank">blandit.</a>
					Maecenas vel 
					nec nunc. Cras facilisis quis nisi id maximus.
				</block>
			</div>
		</div>	

		This might seem like a minute difference, but although both links stand out, a user 
		knows upon hovering over the link on the right that it does something when you click 
		it. Hover effects are an invitation to proceed.

		<h2>Tactile Design - Buttons</h2>
		From working on a lot of different projects, I've found that lots of web developers
		actually struggle with making nice buttons. It doesn't require a lot of CSS, just a few
		basic rules to make buttons feel and look good.

		<h3>Starting Out</h3>
		Let's begin with a basic button. I've seen lots of these working on projects where people
		will just throw together a basic button very hastily.
		<br><br>
		<div id="bad-button">Button</div>
		<br><br>
		This button looks awful, doesn't draw attention to itself, and has no hover effects. 
		It doesn't even have a proper cursor indicating that it's clickable. Let's fix this.

		<h3>Improving with Contrast</h3>
		<div class="button">Button</div>
		<br><br>
		This is already a big improvement. With color changes, increasing the size of the button
		and making the text bold, we make it a lot more obvious that this is a button. Using
		the proper cursor also helps once the user has their mouse over the button. However, a lack
		of a hover effect still makes it feel a bit lackluster.

		<h3>Adding Hover</h3>
		<div class="button with-hover">Button</div>
		<br><br>
		Now with a hover effect, this feels like a real button. This is the baseline of any real
		user experience focused button. It looks clickable (by having contrast) and acts clickable
		by having a simple hover effect. We can go further to add polish though.
		
		<h3>Spicing Things up with Animation</h3>
		<div class="button with-hover with-active">
			<span class="noselect">Send Mail</span>
		</div>
		<br><br>
		This button now has a nicely animated color change on hover, as well as some text animation
		that occurs when the button is clicked. The text animation is a little over the top, and 
		probably would not be used in most cases, but really makes the button come alive.
