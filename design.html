<h1>User Experience Led Design</h1>
<h4>
A basic guide to some principals of design I've come up with as I've worked
on various projects

<h2> Obvious Design - Links </h2>

Good designs make certain things very obvious. On a well designed website,
links look like links, and you know implicitly that you can click them. We'll
explore that idea with a few examples.

<h3> Hover Effects </h3>

Links and other interactive elements should always have proper cursors indicating
they are interactive, and also contrast the elements around them to draw attention.
We won't worry about that for links, though, as HTML and CSS by default style links
in a very distinct blue (which is hopefully not the color of your site's text) and
already has a proper cursor. This makes the link stand out natively, though it
important to keep in mind that just because something looks different does not mean it
is clear that it should be clicked.

<div class="full-width">
	<div class="two-col">
		<block id="with-color">
			ante eu ante laoreet pretium nec nec mauris. Praesent rutrum hendrerit velit,
			ut dapibus enim laoreet
			<a href="/" target="_blank">lobortis.</a>
			Morbi metus quam, porttitor id commodo in,
			nec nunc. Cras facilisis quis nisi id maximus.
		</block>

		<block id="with-hover">
			Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Proin sit amet volutpat
			orci, quis dapibus odio. Sed bibendum felis eget mollis
			<a href="/" target="_blank">blandit.</a>
			Maecenas vel
			nec nunc. Cras facilisis quis nisi id maximus.
		</block>
	</div>
</div>

This might seem like a minute difference, but although both links stand out, a user
knows upon hovering over the link on the right that it does something when you click
it. Hover effects are an invitation to proceed. The link on the right also does not
start out underlined (which looks more modern) and has a color that matches the rest
of the site.

<h3>Not Going Overboard</h3>

<div class="full-width">
	<div class="two-col">
		<block id="with-hover">
			ante eu ante laoreet pretium nec nec mauris. Praesent <a href="/" target="_blank">rutrum hendrerit</a> <a href="/" target="_blank">velit,
			ut dapibus</a> <a href="/" target="_blank">enim laoreet</a>
			<a href="/" target="_blank">lobortis.</a>
			Morbi metus quam, <a href="/" target="_blank">porttitor id</a> commodo in,
			nec nunc. <a href="/" target="_blank">Cras facilisis quis nisi id maximus.</a>
		</block>

		<block id="with-hover">
			Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Proin sit amet volutpat
			orci, quis dapibus odio. Sed bibendum felis eget mollis
			<a href="/" target="_blank">blandit.</a>
			Maecenas vel
			nec nunc. Cras facilisis quis nisi id maximus.
		</block>

<h2>Tactile Design - Buttons</h2>
From working on a lot of different projects, I've found that lots of web developers
actually struggle with making nice buttons. It doesn't require a lot of CSS, just a few
basic rules to make buttons feel and look good.

<h3>Starting Out</h3>
Let's begin with a basic button. I've seen lots of these working on projects where people
will just throw together a basic button very hastily.
<br><br>
<div id="bad-button">Button</div>
<br><br>
This button looks awful, doesn't draw attention to itself, and has no hover effects.
It doesn't even have a proper cursor indicating that it's clickable. Let's fix this.

<h3>Improving with Contrast</h3>
<div class="button">Button</div>
<br><br>
This is already a big improvement. With color changes, increasing the size of the button
and making the text bold, we make it a lot more obvious that this is a button. Using
the proper cursor also helps once the user has their mouse over the button. However, a lack
of a hover effect still makes it feel a bit lackluster.

<h3>Adding Hover</h3>
<div class="button with-hover">Button</div>
<br><br>
Now with a hover effect, this feels like a real button. This is the baseline of any real
user experience focused button. It looks clickable (by having contrast) and acts clickable
by having a simple hover effect. We can go further to add polish though.

<h3>Click Effects</h3>
<div class="button with-hover with-active">Button</div>
<br><br>
Continuing with the tactile and "physical" feel, a click event on this button that makes it
give the illusion of being "pushed in" makes it feel more pleasant.

<h3>Spicing Things up with Animation</h3>
<div class="button with-hover with-active with-animation">
	<span class="noselect">Send Mail</span>
</div>
<br><br>
This button now has a nicely animated color change on hover, as well as some text animation
that occurs when the button is clicked. The text animation is a little over the top, and
probably would not be used in most cases, but really makes the button come alive.
