    developer and accessibility specialist with years of experience working on

  <h2>What I Can Do For You</h2>

  <h3>Build a great website from the ground up</h3>

  <p>
    If you have the design or mockups for a website and need someone to turn it
    into reality, I can help! From writing the code to getting a domain and
    hosting the finished website, I can do it all.
  </p>

  <p>
    Websites I build take advantage of the latest web technology, are accessible,
    responsive, and work across a wide variety of platforms and devices.
  </p>

  <h3>Update your existing website</h3>

  <p>
    If you already have an existing website and wants some updates made to it, I
    can help! Whether it's been made from scratch or powered by WordPress or
    Shopify, I can make any changes you need to your website.
  </p>

  <h3>Improve your website's accessibility</h3>

  <p>
    Web accessibility is a hugely important issue, and if you or your team are
    just learning about it, it can be hard to even know where to start! I can
    recommend accessibility auditors and then improve your website's accessibility
    to make sure that all of your customers have a great experience.
  </p>

  <h2>What I Don't Do</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong><em>Design</em> websites from scratch</strong> - I consider myself
      fairly design-savvy, but I don't make full website designs or mockups.
      Instead, I'd recommend hiring a designer first, so I can make a beautiful
      website for you based on their designs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Perform in-depth accessibility audits</strong> - Although I am an
      accessibility specialist and can check for a wide variety of accessibility
      issues, a robust accessibility audit (especially on a large website)
      requires multiple devices, special software, and lots of time. I'd recommend
      an accessibility auditor for that purpose, and I can then help you fix any
      issues they've spotted.
    </li>
  </ul>
